# Documentation

## Getting Started
### Dependancies
If you would like to build the program yourself, you will need rust and cargo installed.
Install them by following the instructions on [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

### Installation
To install the language, download the executable from the [projectâ€™s repository](https://github.com/GregShiner/cmpsc-470-final/releases) or use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GregShiner/cmpsc-470-final.git
cd cmpsc-470-final

# Build and run the interpreter in REPL mode
cargo run

# Build and run the interpreter with a file input
cargo run -- input.lisp

# Or compile the binary yourself first
# Install dependencies and compile the interpreter
cargo build --release

# Run the language interpreter in REPL mode
./target/release/cmpsc-470-final

# Run the language interpreter with a file input
./target/release/cmpsc-470-final input.lisp

# Run the tests
cargo test
```

## Quick example
Just running the program without any arguments will put you into a REPL environment. However, you can very easily have it execute a file containing a program expression.

Create a file called `example.lisp` with the following contents:
```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```

Then, if you have already compiled the binary:
```sh
./target/release/cmpsc-470-final example.lisp
```

Or, compile the interpreter and run it with:
```sh
cargo run -- example.lisp
```

This will print `Int(3)` to the console.

The interpreter will always output the result of the expression in debug format (`<type>(<contents>)`)

## Reference

### Basic syntax
Statements are written as s-expressions, enclosed in parentheses. Each expression can be an atomic value, an operation, or a nested expression. Code blocks are created with the begin keyword (NOTE: `begin` keyword interpreter has not been implemented yet).

Example:
```lisp
(begin
  (display (+ 3 4))
  (display (+ 5 7)))
```
Output:
```
7
12
Int(12)
```
*`begin` always returns the result of the last expression*

Example:
```lisp
(+ 5 (- 6 3))
```
Output:
```
Int(8)
```

### Data Types Reference

- **Int**: Integer values.
- **Float**: Floating point values.
- **Bool**: Boolean values (true or false).
- **Closure**: Closure created from a `lambda` expression. Contains a body and captures its environment.
- **Box**: Heap-allocated values that support ownership and borrowing.
- **Ref**: Immutable reference to a Box.
- **MutRef**: Mutable reference to a Box.
- **Moved**: Represents a moved (invalid) value. (Only used for internal representation; cannot be constructed on its own)

### Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Purpose            | Example               |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition           | `(+ 5 3)`            |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `(* 5 3)`            |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `(- 5 3)`            |
| `/`      | Division           | `(/ 6 3)`            |
NOTE: All arithmetic operators requires inputs to be either both ints or both floats. They will always return the same type as the input. Diving 2 integers will always do floor division.

#### Comparison Operators
| Operator | Purpose                | Example               |
| -------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| `=`      | Equality               | `(= 5 5)`            |
| `>`      | Greater than           | `(> 5 3)`            |
| `<`      | Less than              | `(< 3 5)`            |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal  | `(>= 5 5)`           |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal     | `(<= 3 5)`           |
NOTE: All comparison operators requires inputs to be either both ints or both floats. They will always output a `Bool` type

### Control Structures

#### If
Used for conditional branching
```lisp
(if (= x 0)
    5
    6)
```
The first argument to `if`, the condition, must resolve to a `Bool`. The remaining arguments can be any type, as long as they are the same. `if` will return the value of the second argument if the condition is true, otherwise, it returns the third argument.

#### Begin
Evaluates multiple expressions in a sequence, and returns the value of the last expression.
```lisp
(begin
  (display "Step 1")
  (display "Step 2"))
```

### Functions and Procedures
Functions are always anonymous lambda functions that can be applied by applying arguments
```lisp
((lambda x (* x 2)) 5) ; Doubles the input, x. Returns Int(10)
```
Define recursive functions using let-rec (sugar not yet implemented, although still possible by manually using y-combinator)
```lisp
(let-rec ((factorial (lambda (n)
                        (if (= n 1)
                            1
                            (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))))
  (factorial 5))
```
You can also create a value binding using the `let` syntactical sugar
```lisp
(let (x 5) (* x 3)) ; outputs 15
```

## Best Practices
- **Memory Management**: Boxed values should be used judiciously because while they are still more performant than garbage collected values, they are still heap allocated which is slower.
- **Mutibility**: Since mutable references cannot exist alongside other references to the same value. Creating mutable references leads to complex problems in scenarios where you need multiple references.
- **Begin**: Pure functions that do not rely on sequencial operations can be heavily optimized and paralellized by the interpreter. Using `begin` expressions reduces the opportunities for optimization heavily.

## Grammar
```antlr
<exp> ::= <int>
        | <float>
        | <id>
        | true
        | false
        | (+ <exp> <exp>)
        | (- <exp> <exp>)
        | (* <exp> <exp>)
        | (/ <exp> <exp>)
        | (lambda (<id>) <exp>)
        | (let (<id> <exp>) exp)
        | (<exp> <exp>)  ; function application
        | (if <exp> <exp> <exp>)
        | (= <exp> <exp>)
        | (> <exp> <exp>)
        | (< <exp> <exp>)
        | (>= <exp> <exp>)
        | (<= <exp> <exp>)
        | (begin <exp>*) ; (interpreter not yet implemented)
        | (& <exp>)      ; immutable reference (interpreter not yet implemented)
        | (! <exp>)      ; mutable reference (interpreter not yet implemented)
        | (box <exp>)    ; (interpreter not yet implemented)
        | (unbox <exp>)  ; (interpreter not yet implemented)
        | (@ <exp>)      ; dereference (interpreter not yet implemented)
        | (:= <exp> <exp>) ; set mutable reference (interpreter not yet implemented)
```
